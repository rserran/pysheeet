System
======

Python provides powerful modules for interacting with the operating system,
making it an excellent choice for system administration, automation, and
scripting tasks. The ``os`` module offers portable access to file systems,
processes, and environment variables, while ``datetime`` handles time and date
operations. The ``pathlib`` module provides an object-oriented interface for
filesystem paths, and ``subprocess`` enables running external commands. This
section covers essential system operations including file manipulation, directory
traversal, process management, and working with dates and times across different
platforms.
