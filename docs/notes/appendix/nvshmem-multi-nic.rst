NVSHMEM Multi-NIC Support with AWS EFA
======================================

:Date: 2026-03-27

Abstract
--------

`NVSHMEM 3.6.5 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvshmem/releases/tag/v3.6.5-0>`_
introduces multi-NIC support for the libfabric transport with round-robin NIC
selection—a collaborative effort between NVIDIA and Amazon Annapurna Labs.
NVSHMEM has gained significant attention since
`DeepEP <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP>`_ demonstrated that
implementing MoE layer dispatch and combine operations with NVSHMEM can
substantially improve performance for large language models (LLMs) employing
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. However, on AWS, DeepEP compatibility
was limited because it relies on
`InfiniBand GPUDirect Async <https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improving-network-performance-of-hpc-systems-using-nvidia-magnum-io-nvshmem-and-gpudirect-async/>`_
(IBGDA), whereas AWS GPU instances support only the proxy thread transport via
libfabric. Furthermore, prior to version 3.6.5, NVSHMEM supported only a
single NIC, meaning each GPU could utilize only one EFA NIC for data
transmission. This article reviews the new multi-NIC feature and presents
experiments exploring the potential performance improvements on AWS.

Introduction
------------

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures rely on all-to-all collective
communication to dispatch and combine tokens across expert replicas. However,
conventional all-to-all implementations often become a bottleneck during LLM
training due to limited overlap with computation and suboptimal bandwidth
utilization. NVSHMEM addresses this by exposing a device-side API that enables
developers to implement custom all-to-all kernels—such as
`pplx-kernels <https://github.com/perplexityai/pplx-kernels>`__ and
`DeepEP <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP>`__\—with GPU-initiated
networking, eliminating costly GPU–CPU context switches.

Despite these advantages, prior NVSHMEM versions (before 3.6.5) supported only
a single NIC per GPU on the libfabric transport. On AWS instances equipped with
multiple EFA NICs, this meant that NVSHMEM-based MoE kernels could not fully
utilize the available network bandwidth, and in practice did not outperform
ordinary all-to-all collective communication.

To evaluate the impact of multi-NIC support, we use the NVSHMEM device
all-to-all performance tool to compare single-NIC and multi-NIC configurations.
We also benchmark
`pplx-kernels <https://github.com/perplexityai/pplx-kernels>`__ to assess
whether MoE dispatch and combine operations benefit from multi-NIC EFA on the
libfabric backend.

NVSHMEM Device All-to-All
-------------------------

To verify that multi-NIC round-robin is functioning correctly, we use
`rdmatop <https://github.com/crazyguitar/rdmatop>`__ to monitor RDMA traffic
across all EFA NICs during NVSHMEM benchmarks. The experiments follow the
NVSHMEM examples in the
`rdmatop <https://github.com/crazyguitar/rdmatop/tree/main/examples/nvshmem>`__
repository.

We run two benchmarks from the NVSHMEM perftest suite on a Slurm cluster. The
first measures point-to-point put bandwidth between a single GPU per node, and
the second measures device-initiated all-to-all latency across all 8 GPUs per
node.

Put Bandwidth (Inter-Node, 1 GPU per Node)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this experiment, we launch a point-to-point job with one sender and one
receiver to verify whether a single GPU can fully utilize all available EFA
NICs via round-robin NIC selection.

.. code-block:: bash

    salloc -N 2 NTASKS_PER_NODE=1 \
      bash examples/nvshmem/nvshmem.sbatch \
      /opt/nvshmem/bin/perftest/device/pt-to-pt/shmem_put_bw \
      -b 8 -e 128M -f 2 -n 1000 -w 100

All-to-All Latency (Device, All 8 GPUs per Node)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This experiment uses the NVSHMEM device all-to-all performance tool to
determine whether all-to-all communication can fully saturate all EFA NICs
when all 8 GPUs per node participate.

.. code-block:: bash

    NODES=2 # 4, 8, 16
    salloc -N ${NODES} bash examples/nvshmem/nvshmem.sbatch \
      /opt/nvshmem/bin/perftest/device/coll/alltoall_latency \
      -b 16 -e 1G -f 2 -n 1000 -s all

pplx-kernels All-to-All
-----------------------

To assess whether real-world MoE workloads benefit from multi-NIC support, we
benchmark `pplx-kernels <https://github.com/ppl-ai/pplx-kernels>`__\—an
NVSHMEM-based implementation of MoE dispatch and combine operations used in
production serving systems such as
`vLLM <https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm>`_. The experiment follows the
pplx example in the
`rdmatop <https://github.com/crazyguitar/rdmatop/tree/main/examples/pplx>`__
repository.

.. code-block:: bash

    salloc -N 2 bash examples/pplx/pplx.sbatch \
      python3 -m tests.bench_all_to_all

Result
------

The following subsections present the results for point-to-point put bandwidth
and device all-to-all latency, comparing NVSHMEM 3.5.21 (single NIC) against
3.6.5 (multi-NIC).

Put Bandwidth (Point-to-Point)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the point-to-point put bandwidth experiment, NVSHMEM 3.5.21 uses only a
single EFA NIC per GPU for both Tx and Rx, as shown by the ``rdmatop`` output
below. This confirms that, prior to multi-NIC support, each GPU was limited to
the bandwidth of one NIC regardless of how many were available on the instance.

With NVSHMEM 3.6.5, the same experiment shows traffic distributed across all 4
EFA NICs via round-robin selection. This allows a single GPU to aggregate
bandwidth from multiple NICs, significantly increasing the achievable
point-to-point throughput.

All-to-All Latency (Device)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the device all-to-all experiment, NVSHMEM 3.5.21 shows that each GPU
utilizes only a single NIC to transfer data, consistent with the point-to-point
results above.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazyguitar/pysheeet/master/docs/_static/appendix/nvshmem/nvshmem-3.5.21.gif

With NVSHMEM 3.6.5, ``rdmatop`` confirms that all Tx NICs carry traffic,
demonstrating that multi-NIC round-robin is active during the all-to-all
operation. However, we observed that Rx traffic was imbalanced across NICs.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazyguitar/pysheeet/master/docs/_static/appendix/nvshmem/nvshmem-3.6.5.gif

This imbalance occurs because all PEs compute the same round-robin target NIC
at the same time, causing all traffic to converge on the same NIC. A fix is
proposed in the PR
`libfabric: fix multi-NIC RX imbalance for EFA transport <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvshmem/pull/76>`_.
After applying the fix, we can observe that Rx traffic is balanced across all
NICs in the all-to-all experiment.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazyguitar/pysheeet/master/docs/_static/appendix/nvshmem/nvshmem-fix.gif

We also compare the all-to-all bandwidth across different node counts for
NVSHMEM 3.5.21, NVSHMEM 3.6.5, and NVSHMEM 3.6.5 with the Rx imbalance fix.
With the fix applied, throughput is significantly higher than both other
configurations. Notably, without the fix, even though NVSHMEM 3.6.5 utilizes
multiple NICs for Tx, the Rx imbalance becomes a bottleneck—resulting in
throughput that can be lower than single-NIC mode, as observed in the 2-node
and 4-node cases.

pplx-kernels All-to-All
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With NVSHMEM 3.6.5 (without the Rx imbalance fix), all Tx and Rx NICs are
active. Although Rx traffic is slightly imbalanced, the MoE dispatch kernel
itself may distribute tokens unevenly across experts, contributing to the
imbalance.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazyguitar/pysheeet/master/docs/_static/appendix/nvshmem/nvshmem-all2all-pplx-original.gif

With NVSHMEM 3.6.5 and the Rx imbalance fix applied, all Tx and Rx NICs
remain active, and Rx traffic appears relatively more balanced. However, the
MoE dispatch and combine bandwidth shows no significant difference compared to
the unfixed version.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazyguitar/pysheeet/master/docs/_static/appendix/nvshmem/nvshmem-all2all-pplx.gif

Comparing the two configurations, NVSHMEM bandwidth is relatively higher with
the Rx imbalance fix applied. However, other factors such as kernel computation
may dominate the overall MoE kernel performance, resulting in similar dispatch
and combine throughput between the two versions.

Conclusion
----------

NVSHMEM 3.6.5 introduces multi-NIC support for the libfabric transport,
enabling round-robin NIC selection on AWS instances equipped with multiple EFA
NICs. Our experiments confirm that this feature allows both point-to-point and
all-to-all NVSHMEM operations to distribute traffic across all available NICs,
significantly increasing aggregate bandwidth compared to older NVSHMEM
versions.

However, we identified an Rx imbalance issue in the initial 3.6.5 release,
where all PEs select the same round-robin target NIC simultaneously, causing Rx
traffic to converge on a single NIC. This imbalance can degrade all-to-all
throughput to levels below single-NIC mode in certain configurations. A
proposed fix addresses this by offsetting the round-robin selection per PE,
resulting in balanced Rx traffic and substantially improved all-to-all
bandwidth.

For pplx-kernels, multi-NIC support successfully distributes traffic across all
EFA NICs. While NVSHMEM-level bandwidth improves with the Rx fix, the
end-to-end MoE dispatch and combine throughput shows minimal difference,
suggesting that kernel computation rather than network bandwidth is the
dominant factor in these workloads.

Overall, multi-NIC support in NVSHMEM 3.6.5 is an important step toward
enabling NVSHMEM-based MoE kernels to fully utilize the network capacity of
AWS GPU instances, and can potentially improve MoE kernel throughput for
large-scale LLM training and serving workloads.
