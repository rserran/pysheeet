Appendix
--------

This section explores advanced programming topics to help users build a deeper
understanding of complex concepts and practical techniques. For instance, ``asyncio``
introduces event-driven programming in Python, but its async/await syntax can
feel unfamiliar to many developers. Likewise, programmers working in other
languages, such as C/C++, often use Python as a versatile debugging tool.
With debuggers like GDB, they may write Python scripts to parse memory regions,
improve output readability, or automate troubleshooting tasks.
