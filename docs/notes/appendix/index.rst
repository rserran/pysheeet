Appendix
--------

This section explores advanced programming topics to help users build a deeper
understanding of complex concepts and practical techniques. Programmers working
in other languages, such as C/C++, often use Python as a versatile debugging
tool. With debuggers like GDB, they may write Python scripts to parse memory
regions, improve output readability, or automate troubleshooting tasks.

More advanced topics and examples can be found in the following link.
