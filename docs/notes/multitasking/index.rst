Multitasking
============

Python provides multiple approaches for concurrent and parallel execution.
Threading and multiprocessing handle CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks using
OS-level primitives, while asyncio provides cooperative multitasking for
high-performance I/O-bound applications. This section covers all three
approaches with practical examples.
