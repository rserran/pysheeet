Database
========

Working with databases is a core skill for most Python applications, from web
development to data analysis. SQLAlchemy is Python's most popular database
toolkit, providing both a low-level SQL expression language (Core) and a
high-level Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). This section covers SQLAlchemy from
basic connections and queries to advanced patterns like relationships, eager
loading, and complex joins. Whether you're building a simple script or a
large-scale application, these examples will help you interact with databases
efficiently and safely.
