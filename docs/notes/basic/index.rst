    :description lang=en: Python basics cheat sheet covering syntax, data types, functions, classes, generators, typing, and essential Python programming concepts
    :keywords: Python, Python3, basics, syntax, data types, functions, classes, generators, typing, list, dict, set, comprehension

Quick Start
===========

This cheat sheet is designed to help developers learn Python syntax from the
ground up. It covers the fundamentals while also introducing common patterns
and idioms that experienced Python developers use, which may feel unfamiliar to
beginners. For instance, constructs like ``for ... else ...`` are rarely seen in
other programming languages. Additionally, we’ll explore interesting topics such
as ``__future__``, typing, and Unicode—concepts you may have heard of but never
fully understood. By working through this cheat sheet, you’ll gain a solid
foundation in Python and learn to write code that feels truly Pythonic.
