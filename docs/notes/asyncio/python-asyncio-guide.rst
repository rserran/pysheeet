Abstract
--------

The `C10k problem`_ remains a fundamental challenge for programmers seeking to
handle massive concurrent connections efficiently. Traditionally, developers
address extensive I/O operations using **threads**, **epoll**, or **kqueue** to
prevent software from blocking on expensive operations. However, developing
readable and bug-free concurrent code is challenging due to complexities around
data sharing and task dependencies. Even powerful tools like `Valgrind`_ that
help detect deadlocks and race conditions cannot eliminate the time-consuming
debugging process as software scales.

To address these challenges, many programming languages—including Python,
JavaScript, and C++—have developed better libraries, frameworks, and syntaxes
to help programmers manage concurrent tasks properly. Rather than focusing on
how to use modern parallel APIs, this article concentrates on the **design
philosophy** behind asynchronous programming patterns, tracing the evolution
from blocking I/O to the elegant ``async/await`` syntax.

Using threads is the most natural approach for dispatching tasks without
blocking the main thread. However, threads introduce performance overhead from
context switching and require careful locking of critical sections for atomic
operations. While event loops can enhance performance in I/O-bound scenarios,
writing readable event-driven code is challenging due to callback complexity
(commonly known as "callback hell"). Fortunately, Python introduced the
``async/await`` syntax to help developers write understandable code with high
performance. The following figure illustrates how ``async/await`` enables
handling socket connections with the simplicity of threads but the efficiency
of event loops.

Introduction
------------

Handling I/O operations such as network connections is among the most expensive
tasks in any program. Consider a simple TCP blocking echo server (shown below).
If a client connects without sending any data, it blocks all other connections.
Even when clients send data promptly, the server cannot handle concurrent
requests because it wastes significant time waiting for I/O responses from
hardware like network interfaces. Thus, socket programming with concurrency
becomes essential for managing high request volumes.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10)

    while True:
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        msg = conn.recv(1024)
        conn.send(msg)

One solution to prevent blocking is dispatching tasks to separate threads. The
following example demonstrates handling connections simultaneously using threads.
However, creating numerous threads consumes computing resources without
proportional throughput gains. Worse, applications may waste time waiting for
locks when processing tasks in critical sections. While threads solve blocking
issues, factors like CPU utilization and memory overhead remain critical for
solving the C10k problem. Without creating unlimited threads, the **event loop**
provides an alternative solution for managing connections efficiently.

.. code-block:: python

    import threading
    import socket

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10240)

    def handler(conn):
        while True:
            msg = conn.recv(65535)
            conn.send(msg)

    while True:
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        t = threading.Thread(target=handler, args=(conn,))
        t.start()

A simple event-driven socket server comprises three main components: an **I/O
multiplexing module** (e.g., `select`_), a **scheduler** (the loop), and
**callback functions** (event handlers). The following server uses Python's
high-level I/O multiplexing module, `selectors`_, within a loop to check
whether I/O operations are ready. When data becomes available for reading or
writing, the loop retrieves I/O events and executes the appropriate callback
functions—``accept``, ``read``, or ``write``—to complete tasks.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket
    from selectors import DefaultSelector, EVENT_READ, EVENT_WRITE
    from functools import partial

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10240)
    s.setblocking(False)

    sel = DefaultSelector()

    def accept(s, mask):
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        conn.setblocking(False)
        sel.register(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    def read(conn, mask):
        msg = conn.recv(65535)
        if not msg:
            sel.unregister(conn)
            return conn.close()
        sel.modify(conn, EVENT_WRITE, partial(write, msg=msg))

    def write(conn, mask, msg=None):
        if msg:
            conn.send(msg)
        sel.modify(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    sel.register(s, EVENT_READ, accept)
    while True:
        events = sel.select()
        for e, m in events:
            cb = e.data
            cb(e.fileobj, m)

Although managing connections via threads may be inefficient, event-loop-based
programs are harder to read and maintain. To enhance code readability, many
programming languages—including Python—introduce abstract concepts such as
**coroutines**, **futures**, and **async/await** to handle I/O multiplexing
elegantly. The following sections explore these concepts and the problems they
solve.

Callback Functions
------------------

Callback functions control data flow at runtime when events occur. However,
preserving state across callbacks is challenging. For example, implementing a
handshake protocol over TCP requires storing previous state somewhere accessible
to subsequent callbacks.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket
    from selectors import DefaultSelector, EVENT_READ, EVENT_WRITE
    from functools import partial

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10240)
    s.setblocking(False)

    sel = DefaultSelector()
    is_hello = {}

    def accept(s, mask):
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        conn.setblocking(False)
        is_hello[conn] = False
        sel.register(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    def read(conn, mask):
        msg = conn.recv(65535)
        if not msg:
            sel.unregister(conn)
            return conn.close()

        # Check whether handshake is successful
        if is_hello[conn]:
            sel.modify(conn, EVENT_WRITE, partial(write, msg=msg))
            return

        # Perform handshake
        if msg.decode("utf-8").strip() != "hello":
            sel.unregister(conn)
            return conn.close()

        is_hello[conn] = True

    def write(conn, mask, msg=None):
        if msg:
            conn.send(msg)
        sel.modify(conn, EVENT_READ, read)

    sel.register(s, EVENT_READ, accept)
    while True:
        events = sel.select()
        for e, m in events:
            cb = e.data
            cb(e.fileobj, m)

Although the ``is_hello`` dictionary stores state to track handshake status,
the code becomes difficult to understand. The underlying logic is actually
simple—equivalent to this blocking version:

.. code-block:: python

    def accept(s):
        conn, addr = s.accept()
        success = handshake(conn)
        if not success:
            conn.close()

    def handshake(conn):
        data = conn.recv(65535)
        if not data:
            return False
        if data.decode('utf-8').strip() != "hello":
            return False
        conn.send(b"hello")
        return True

To achieve similar structure in non-blocking code, a function (or task) must
snapshot its current state—including arguments, local variables, and execution
position—when waiting for I/O operations. The scheduler must then be able to
**re-enter** the function and execute remaining code after I/O completes.
Unlike languages like C++, Python achieves this naturally because **generators**
preserve all state and can be re-entered by calling ``next()``. By utilizing
generators, handling I/O operations in a non-blocking manner with readable,
linear code—called *inline callbacks*—becomes possible within an event loop.

Event Loop
----------

An event loop is a user-space scheduler that manages tasks within a program
instead of relying on operating system thread scheduling. The following snippet
demonstrates a simple event loop handling socket connections asynchronously.
The implementation appends tasks to a FIFO job queue and registers with a
*selector* when I/O operations are not ready. A *generator* preserves task
state, allowing execution to resume without callback functions when I/O results
become available. Understanding how this event loop works reveals that a Python
generator is indeed a form of **coroutine**.

.. code-block:: python

    # loop.py

    from selectors import DefaultSelector, EVENT_READ, EVENT_WRITE

    class Loop:
        def __init__(self):
            self.sel = DefaultSelector()
            self.queue = []

        def create_task(self, task):
            self.queue.append(task)

        def polling(self):
            for e, m in self.sel.select(0):
                self.queue.append((e.data, None))
                self.sel.unregister(e.fileobj)

        def is_registered(self, fileobj):
            try:
                self.sel.get_key(fileobj)
            except KeyError:
                return False
            return True

        def register(self, t, data):
            if not data:
                return False

            event_type, fileobj = data
            if event_type in (EVENT_READ, EVENT_WRITE):
                if self.is_registered(fileobj):
                    self.sel.modify(fileobj, event_type, t)
                else:
                    self.sel.register(fileobj, event_type, t)
                return True
            return False

        def accept(self, s):
            while True:
                try:
                    conn, addr = s.accept()
                except BlockingIOError:
                    yield (EVENT_READ, s)
                else:
                    break
            return conn, addr

        def recv(self, conn, size):
            while True:
                try:
                    msg = conn.recv(size)
                except BlockingIOError:
                    yield (EVENT_READ, conn)
                else:
                    break
            return msg

        def send(self, conn, msg):
            while True:
                try:
                    size = conn.send(msg)
                except BlockingIOError:
                    yield (EVENT_WRITE, conn)
                else:
                    break
            return size

        def once(self):
            self.polling()
            unfinished = []
            for t, data in self.queue:
                try:
                    data = t.send(data)
                except StopIteration:
                    continue

                if self.register(t, data):
                    unfinished.append((t, None))

            self.queue = unfinished

        def run(self):
            while self.queue or self.sel.get_map():
                self.once()

By assigning jobs to an event loop, the programming pattern resembles using
threads but with a user-level scheduler. `PEP 380`_ introduced generator
delegation via ``yield from``, allowing a generator to wait for other generators
to complete. The following snippet is far more intuitive and readable than
callback-based I/O handling:

.. code-block:: python

    # server.py
    # $ python3 server.py &
    # $ nc localhost 5566

    import socket
    from loop import Loop

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 5566))
    s.listen(10240)
    s.setblocking(False)

    loop = Loop()

    def handler(conn):
        while True:
            msg = yield from loop.recv(conn, 1024)
            if not msg:
                conn.close()
                break
            yield from loop.send(conn, msg)

    def main():
        while True:
            conn, addr = yield from loop.accept(s)
            conn.setblocking(False)
            loop.create_task((handler(conn), None))

    loop.create_task((main(), None))
    loop.run()

Using an event loop with ``yield from`` manages connections without blocking
the main thread—this was how ``asyncio`` worked before Python 3.5. However,
``yield from`` is ambiguous: why does adding ``@asyncio.coroutine`` transform
a generator into a coroutine? Instead of overloading generator syntax for
asynchronous operations, `PEP 492`_ proposed that coroutines should become a
**standalone concept** in Python. This led to the introduction of ``async/await``
syntax, dramatically improving readability for asynchronous programming.

What is a Coroutine?
--------------------

Python documentation defines coroutines as "a generalized form of subroutines."
This definition, while technically accurate, can be confusing. Based on our
discussion, an event loop schedules generators to perform specific tasks—similar
to how an OS dispatches jobs to threads. In this context, generators serve as
"routine workers." A **coroutine** is simply a task scheduled by an event loop
within a program, rather than by the operating system.

The following snippet illustrates what ``@coroutine`` does. This decorator
transforms a function into a generator function and wraps it with
``types.coroutine`` for backward compatibility:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import inspect
    import types
    from functools import wraps
    from asyncio.futures import Future

    def coroutine(func):
        """Simple prototype of coroutine decorator"""
        if inspect.isgeneratorfunction(func):
            return types.coroutine(func)

        @wraps(func)
        def coro(*a, **k):
            res = func(*a, **k)
            if isinstance(res, Future) or inspect.isgenerator(res):
                res = yield from res
            return res
        return types.coroutine(coro)

    @coroutine
    def foo():
        yield from asyncio.sleep(1)
        print("Hello Foo")

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(loop.create_task(foo()))
    loop.close()

With Python 3.5+, the ``async def`` syntax creates native coroutines directly,
and ``await`` replaces ``yield from`` for suspending execution. This makes the
intent explicit: ``async def`` declares a coroutine, and ``await`` marks
suspension points where the event loop can switch to other tasks.

Conclusion
----------

Asynchronous programming via event loops has become more straightforward and
readable thanks to modern syntax and library support. Most programming
languages, including Python, implement libraries that manage task scheduling
through integration with new syntaxes. While ``async/await`` may seem enigmatic
initially, it provides a way for programmers to develop logical, linear code
structure—similar to using threads—while gaining the performance benefits of
event-driven I/O.

Without callback functions passing state between handlers, programmers no
longer need to worry about preserving local variables and arguments across
asynchronous boundaries. This allows developers to focus on application logic
rather than spending time troubleshooting concurrency issues. The evolution
from callbacks to generators to ``async/await`` represents a significant
advancement in making concurrent programming accessible and maintainable.
