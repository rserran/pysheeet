PyTorch
=======

PyTorch is a leading deep learning framework known for its dynamic computation
graphs, intuitive Python API, and strong GPU acceleration support. Developed by
Meta AI, it has become the preferred choice for research and increasingly for
production deployments. This section covers PyTorch fundamentals including tensor
operations, neural network construction, model training, and GPU utilization.
For large-scale training, we also cover distributed computing with Slurm, the
workload manager commonly used on HPC clusters and cloud GPU instances.
