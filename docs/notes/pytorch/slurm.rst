Slurm
=====

Slurm is an open-source job scheduling and workload management system widely
used in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. It is designed to efficiently
allocate resources, manage queues, and dispatch jobs across large numbers of compute
nodes. For example, machine learning engineers can use Slurm to launch distributed
training jobs for large language models (LLMs) sharded across multiple nodes.

Compared to systems like Kubernetes—which often requires additional components
such as Kubeflow for ML workload scheduling—Slurm provides a simpler, HPC-focused
workflow. Users can submit and manage jobs directly with commands like
``srun``, ``sbatch``, and ``squeue``, without needing to configure complex
orchestration layers.

Slurm Info
----------

``sinfo`` is a command used to display general information about a Slurm-managed
cluster, such as the number of available nodes and partitions. It also allows
users to check the status of nodes, including identifying nodes that are down or
in an error state.

.. code-block:: bash

    # show slurm general info
    sinfo

    # show partition info
    sinfo -s
    sinfo --summarize

    # show partition info
    PARTITION=dev
    sinfo -p ${PARTITION}

    # show nodes in idle state
    sinfo --state=idle

Submit Jobs
-----------

Launching a job across multiple nodes in the foreground is straightforward with
``srun``. For example, running ``srun hostname`` will execute the ``hostname`` command
on multiple allocated nodes and wait for all nodes to return results. With ``srun``,
users can easily specify:

* Number of nodes to run the job on (``--nodes``)
* Partition or queue to submit the job to (``--partition``)
* Time limit for the job (``--time``), ensuring compute resources are automatically released when the job finishes or reaches its time limit

By default, ``srun`` runs interactively in the foreground, making it ideal for quick
tests or debugging. For longer or batch jobs, users typically pair srun with job
scripts submitted via ``sbatch``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Submit a job to a compute node
    srun -N1 hostname

    # Submit a job on specific nodes
    srun --nodelist=compute-[0-5] hostname

    # Submit a job to a specific partition
    PARTITION=dev
    srun -p ${PARTITION} --nodelist=compute-[0-5] hostname

    # Submit a job via srun on 2 nodes (using dd to simulate a high CPU consume job)
    srun -N2 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null

    # Submit a job with time constrain.
    # - minute
    # - minute:second
    # - hours:minutes:seconds
    # - days-hours
    # - days-hours:minutes
    # - days-hours:minutes:seconds
    #
    # ex: The following job will be timeout after 1m30s
    srun -N2 --time=01:30 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null

    # login to a node
    srun -N 1 --pty /bin/bash

Alloc Nodes
-----------

In some scenarios, users may need exclusive, interactive access to specific
nodes for experiments or testing. For instance, a researcher running benchmarking
tests might require all benchmarks to execute on the same fixed nodes to ensure
consistent and reproducible results. The salloc command is used to request and
allocate resources interactively. By using ``salloc``, users can reserve a specific
number of nodes, ensuring that no other jobs are scheduled on them during the
experiment. This isolation helps avoid resource contention that could affect
benchmarking or performance measurements. For example, the following command
allocates 2 nodes for an interactive session:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Allocte 2 nodes and submit a job on those allocated nodes
    salloc -N 2
    srun hostname
    exit # release allocated nodes


    # Allocate nodes on a specific partition
    PARTITION=dev
    salloc -N 2 -p ${PARTITION}

.. image:: images/salloc.svg


.. note::

    ``salloc`` is particularly useful for:

    * Interactive debugging
    * Benchmarking and performance testing
    * Running exploratory workloads without writing a full job script

Cancel Jobs
-----------

Users may occasionally need to cancel their jobs for various reasons. For example,
a cluster administrator may announce maintenance (such as upgrading system libraries),
requiring users to terminate running jobs. In other cases, a job might hang or
consume compute resources unnecessarily, making cancellation necessary. Slurm
provides the ``scancel`` command to terminate jobs cleanly. Example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    # cancel a job
    scancel "${jobid}"

    # cancel a job and disable warnings
    scancel -q "${jobid}"

    # cancel all jobs which are belong to an account
    scancel --account="${account}"

    # cancel all jobs which are belong to a partition
    scancel --partition="${partition}"

    # cancel all pending jobs
    scancel --state="PENDING"

    # cancel all running jobs
    scancel --state="RUNNING"

    # cancel all jobs
    squeue -l | awk '{ print $ 1}' | grep '[[:digit:]].*' | xargs scancel

    # cancel all jobs (using state option)
    for s in "RUNNING" "PENDING" "SUSPAND"; do scancel --state="$s"; done


Submit Batch Jobs
-----------------

``sbatch`` is a Slurm command used to submit batch jobs for execution on a
cluster. Unlike ``srun``, which typically runs jobs interactively in the foreground,
``sbatch`` is designed for running long, non-interactive workloads in the background.
This allows users to submit jobs without maintaining an active SSH session to the
cluster's head node, making it ideal for large-scale or time-consuming tasks.

A typical workflow involves writing a Slurm job script containing job specifications
(such as the number of nodes, time limits, and partitions) and one or more srun
commands to execute programs. Submitting this script with sbatch queues the job,
and Slurm automatically schedules it based on available resources. Example sbatch
script:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --nodelist=compute-[0-1]
    #SBATCH --output=logs/%x_%j.out
    #SBATCH --error=logs/%x_%j.out
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=8

    master_addr="$(scontrol show hostnames | sort | head -n 1)"
    srun hostname
    srun torchrun \
      --nproc-per-node="$SLURM_NPROCS" \
      --nnodes="$SLURM_NNODES"
      --master-addr="${master_addr}" \
      --master-port=29500 \
      ${PWD}/train.py

    # sbatch job.sh

Submit mpirun
-------------

In some HPC environments, users may not be able to load the MPI module directly
on the head (login) node due to security restrictions, minimal software installations,
or site policies that restrict heavy workloads on login nodes. In such cases,
the workflow is to use Slurm to allocate compute nodes and launch ``mpirun`` from
within one of those nodes. From there, mpirun orchestrates the execution of the
MPI program across all allocated nodes.

.. image:: images/mpirun.svg

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    # Usage:
    #
    # rank_per_node=8
    # salloc -N 4
    # ./mpirun.sh ${rank_per_node} ${binary}

    launch() {
      local rank_per_node="${1}"
      local args=("${@:2}")
      local arr
      local hosts
      local cmd

      mapfile -t arr < <(scontrol show hostnames | sort)
      OLDIFS="${IFS}"
      IFS=","
      hosts="${arr[*]}"
      IFS="${OLDIFS}"

      cmd="$(cat <<EOF

      mpirun \
      -N "${rank_per_node}" \
      --allow-run-as-root \
      --host "${hosts}" \
      --mca pml ^cm --mca plm_rsh_no_tree_spawn 1 \
      --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0,veth_def_agent \
      --mca plm_rsh_num_concurrent "${#arr[@]}" \
      --mca btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism none \
      --oversubscribe \
      --tag-output \
      ${args[@]}

    EOF
    )"

      # submit a mpirun job to a single node because mpirun will launch jobs on
      # other nodes. Therfore, it is required to spcify -N 1 when using srun.
      srun -N 1 bash -c "${cmd}"
    }

    launch "$@"

Submit Jobs with Enroot
-----------------------

Sometimes, users need to run jobs with custom dependencies that differ from the
cluster’s system-wide environment. For example, if the cluster is configured with
NCCL 2.23 but a user wants to benchmark NCCL 2.27, it’s often impractical to ask
administrators to upgrade or modify system libraries for a single experiment.
One workaround is to create a custom container (e.g., Docker image) with the
required dependencies and launch jobs from that environment. However, running
containers in HPC environments often requires extra setup and special flags
due to namespace isolation and security restrictions.

To simplify this process, `Enroot <https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot>`_ provides
a lightweight alternative to traditional container runtimes. It allows users to
run isolated filesystem in an HPC setting with minimal overhead, similar to
``chroot``, while still granting direct access to system hardware (e.g., GPUs, interconnects).
This makes it ideal for ML and HPC workflows that require fine-tuned performance.

Building on Enroot, `Pyxis <https://github.com/NVIDIA/pyxis>`_ is a Slurm plugin
that enables launching jobs inside Enroot containers without writing additional
wrapper scripts. Users can specify Enroot squash file and runtime options directly
in their sbatch or srun commands, integrating container workflows seamlessly into
Slurm job submission. The following snippet shows serveral to launch a job through
Enroot and Pyxis.

.. code-block:: bash

   # build an enroot sqsh file
   $ enroot import -o "${output_sqsh}" "dockerd://${image}"

   # submit a job with enroot
   srun --container-image "${output_sqsh}" \
     --container-mounts "/fsx:/fsx,/nfs:/nfs" \
     --ntasks-per-node=8 \
     ${cmd}

   # submit a mpi job with enroot
   srun --container-image "${output_sqsh}" \
     --container-mounts "/fsx:/fsx,/nfs:/nfs" \
     --ntasks-per-node=8 \
     --mpi=pmix \
     ${cmd}

Job Status
----------

To monitor the status of jobs in a Slurm-managed cluster, users can use the
``squeue`` command. This tool shows essential details about submitted jobs, such
as job IDs, job names, partitions, allocated nodes, and job states. Common job
states include:

* RUNNING – The job is actively running on allocated resources.
* PENDING – The job is waiting in the queue for resources to become available.
* FAILED – The job has failed due to errors or unmet conditions.

If a job is stuck, fails, or behaves unexpectedly, you can terminate it with
the ``scancel`` command and resubmit after fixing the issue.

.. code-block:: bash

   # check all Slurm jobs status
   squeue

   # check user's job status
   squeue --user=${USER}

Reservation
-----------

From an administrator’s perspective, it may be necessary to reserve specific
nodes to prevent Slurm from scheduling jobs on them. For example, nodes
experiencing hardware or software issues—such as network failures or disk
errors—should be reserved to avoid job failures. Reserving nodes allows
administrators to troubleshoot, repair, or perform maintenance without
interfering with active workloads. The following snippet demonstrates how to
create reservations through ``scontrol`` for nodes and check their reservation status.

.. code-block:: bash

    # reserve nodes for a user to test
    # - minute
    # - minute:second
    # - hours:minutes:seconds
    # - days-hours
    # - days-hours:minutes
    # - days-hours:minutes:seconds
    #
    # ex: reserve all nodes 120m for maintenance
    scontrol create reservation ReservationName=maintenance \
        starttime=now duration=120 user=root flags=maint,ignore_jobs nodes=ALL

    # must specify reservation; otherwise, the job will not run
    srun --reservation=maintain ping 8.8.8.8 2>&1 > /dev/null

    # show reservations
    scontrol show res

    # delete a reservation
    scontrol delete ReservationName=maintain

    # drain nodes for maintenance. ex: nodes=compute-[01-02],compute-08
    scontrol update NodeName=compute-[01-02],compute-08 State=DOWN Reason=”maintenance”

    # resume nodes
    scontrol update NodeName=compute-[01-02],compute-08 State=Resume

Accounting
----------

Slurm includes a powerful accounting and resource management system that allows
administrators to control how computing resources are allocated and ensure fair
usage across all users. Through this system, administrators can configure fairshare
scheduling, job priority policies, and resource limits to prevent individual
users or groups from monopolizing cluster resources for extended periods.

With ``fairshare``, Slurm dynamically adjusts job priorities based on historical
resource usage, ensuring that users who have consumed fewer resources get higher
priority in the job queue, while heavy users may experience lower priority until
usage balances out. This helps maintain equitable access in multi-user HPC environments.
Administrators manage these policies through Slurm’s database-backed accounting
system (``slurmdbd``) and commands like:

.. code-block:: bash

    # create a cluster (the clustername should be identical to ClusterName in slurm.conf)
    sacctmgr add cluster clustername

    # create an account
    sacctmgr -i add account worker description="worker account" Organization="your.org"

    # create an user and add to an account
    sacctmgr create user name=worker DefaultAccount=default

    # create an user and add to additional accounts
    sacctmgr -i create user "worker" account="worker" adminlevel="None"

    # modify user fairshare configuration
    sacctmgr modify user where name="worker" account="worker" set fairshare=0

    # remove an user from an account
    sacctmgr remove user "worker" where account="worker"

    # show all users
    sacctmgr show account

    # show all users with associations
    sacctmgr show account -s
